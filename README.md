# Web-Based OCR
This project is a web-based prototype that performs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on images containing both Hindi and English text. It allows users to upload an image, extract the text, and perform keyword searches within the extracted content. The app is built using Streamlit and EasyOCR and is accessible via a live URL.
